Ownership is a set of rules which govern memory management. These rules are enforced at compile time. If any rules are violated, the program will not compile.

The three rules of ownership are:
1 - each value in Rust has an owner
2 - There can be only one owner at a time
3 - When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped

Ownership prevents memory safety issues.
